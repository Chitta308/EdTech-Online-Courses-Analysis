## üéØ Power BI Dashboard | EdTech Online Courses Analysis

**I recently worked on a real-world Power BI project based on an EdTech startup scenario, where the goal was to extract meaningful insights from course data to help the company grow its recorded lecture offerings strategically.**

üìä Using Power BI, I designed an interactive dashboard that visualizes multiple perspectives of the data to support data-driven decisions.
Here are the 9 business problems I addressed through this dashboard:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Examine the distribution of course types across categories and subcategories to uncover trends and learner demand.
 
2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the average number of views for each category, sub-category, and language to identify engagement patterns.
 
3Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the most commonly taught skills to ensure offerings stay relevant to the job market.
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ Analyze the distribution of course languages to understand accessibility and reach.
 
5Ô∏è‚É£ Determine the language preferences for each category (top 5 categories) to optimize content alignment.
 
6Ô∏è‚É£ Investigate the impact of subtitles on views to measure their influence on engagement and accessibility.
 
7Ô∏è‚É£ Identify the top 3 instructors per category and subcategory based on ratings to highlight quality educators.
 
8Ô∏è‚É£ Explore the relationship between course duration and views to understand engagement patterns.
 
9Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate how the variety of skills within each category/subcategory affects total viewership.
